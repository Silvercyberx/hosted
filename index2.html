<p>                   To My Favorite Star💨😌❤️Adanna!!!
<br>
My Ada,
Another sunrise found its way to you  and this one feels different.
Maybe it’s because the heavens themselves remember that this was the day the world was gifted with your light.
You’ve always had that kind of presence soft but strong, quiet yet unignorable, like peace that hums beneath a storm.

<br>Today isn’t just about candles and wishes, it’s about gratitude.
Gratitude that you exist.
Gratitude that your laughter still carries music even after life tried to make you silent.
Gratitude that your kindness never hardened, even when life gave you every reason to.
<br>
You’ve been my calm in chaos, my reason to slow down and breathe
You remind me that love isn’t about perfection, it’s about patience and presence.
You, Ada, are still the little princess from every fairy tale I ever believed in 
the one who doesn’t wait to be rescued, but rescues hearts with her warmth.
<br>
And even though we’ve had our rough days those little storms of silence and pride 
I never stopped choosing you.
Every time the sun sets, I still find my thoughts wandering back to you.
You’re my favorite star, the one that never stopped shining, even when clouds tried to hide it.
<br>
So, on this day, I pray your path glows a little brighter,
that laughter finds you easily,
that peace sits beside you like an old friend,
and that God keeps decorating your tomorrow with more reasons to smile.
<br>
You are loved, deeply.
You are seen, wholly.
And you are celebrated today, tomorrow, and always.
<br>
Happy Birthday, my Ada.
You’ll forever be one of God’s best ideas💨❤️🫂
<br>
Yours, always in awe,
Wanimi
